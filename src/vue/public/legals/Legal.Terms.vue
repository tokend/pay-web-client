          we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding
          and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your

          third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Site or these Terms (as well as

          substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless
          otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial
          Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
          Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”). Where no claims or counterclaims exceed $10,000,
          the dispute will be resolved by the submission of documents without a hearing, unless a hearing is requested by
          a party or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, in which case, a party may elect to participate telephonically.

          the state or municipality of your residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as

          claims of defamation, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or
          trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the

          agreement to arbitrate, you or us may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located

        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR
          HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
          Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING;
          (B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF
          A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to
          demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will
          pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary
          to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also
          reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of
          the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the
          arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any
          arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration
          award; (g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any
          individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) you and we will
          pay our respective attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the
          prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and
          expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the
          applicable law.
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          This Section will survive termination of your account and these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any
          debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) above of this
          Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is
          deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the
          balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms
          as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either
          subpart (a) or (b) above of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of
          this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration. If for
          any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in
          state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.

          YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF

        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          If you are a copyright owner or agent thereof and believe any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may
          submit a written notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) to our copyright agent at
          sales@tokend.org.
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          In order to take action, your notice must:
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          Include your physical or electronic signature.
          <br>
          Identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single
          online site are covered by a single notice, a representative list of such works at that site. As an example, you
          might state that the copyrighted work that was infringed is located on Page 123 of the book “Parenting 1, 2, 3”
          written by John Doe, published by Rainbow Publishing in 2007, ISBN 1231231231.</p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          Identify the Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to
          be removed or access to which is to be disabled and provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to
          locate the Content. For example, you might state that the Content located in paragraph 4 of message #1234 is
          substantially the same as what is written on Page 123 of Parenting 1, 2, 3.
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          Provide a way for us to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, or email address. Include in your
          notice the following statement: “I believe in good faith that the use of copyrighted material described in this
          notice was not authorized by the owner of the copyright, an agent of the owner of the copyright, or applicable
          law.”
          <br>
          Include in your notice the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information I have
          set forth in this notice is accurate, and I am either (1) the owner of the copyright; (2) someone authorized to
          act on behalf of the owner of the copyright; or (3) someone authorized to act on behalf of someone who holds an
          exclusive right to use the copyright in the manner in which it has been infringed.”</p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          We cannot take action unless you give us all required information, and you acknowledge that if you fail to
          comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          Please note that you can be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you wrongfully
          claim that Content infringes your copyright. If you are not sure whether Content infringes your copyright, you
          should first contact an attorney and seek legal advice.
        </p>
        <p class="legal__paragraph">
          If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that
          you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to applicable law,
          to post and use such material, you may submit a written counter-notice to our copyright agent at
          sales@tokend.org. In order to take action, your counter-notice must: (1) include your physical or electronic
          signature; (2) identify your Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location
          at which your Content appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; (3) include a statement,
          under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that your Content was removed or disabled as a
          result of mistake or a misidentification of your Content; and (4) include your name, address, and telephone
          number and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district
          in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district
          in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
          notice to us or an agent of such person. If a proper counter-notice is received by our copyright agent, we may
          send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace
          the removed Content or cease disabling it in ten business days. We may, in our discretion, replace or restore
          access to the removed Content and cease disabling access to it in ten to 14 business days or more after receipt
          of the counter-notice, unless our designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the DMCA
          notice that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the owner of the removed Content
          from engaging in infringing activity relating to such Content.
